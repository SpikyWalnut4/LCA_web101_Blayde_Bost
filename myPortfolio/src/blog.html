            <li>Day 1 of Coding</li>    
                <ul>I learned how to start a base code for my portfolio website. We put in a custom background and our own image for our self photo.</ul>

                <ul>What really excites me is that I can make a website and code it just how I would like. It gives me control over the code and I know more about websites and code.</ul>
            
                <ul>It tells the program what coding language you are using and should be put in at the beginning of your code.</ul>

                <ul>I believe it determines how the layout of the code will be for that pacific code.</ul>

            <li>Day 2 of COding</li>
                <ul>I learned how to put a “link” in my website so people can click on it to go to my blogs. Also I learned that coding will get frustrating and won’t work sometimes, even if you have everything set up and it all is written good.</ul>

                <ul>The workflow is pretty easy as long as you have a general idea on what you are trying to make your website look and feel like.</ul>

                <ul>ARIA and screen readers are programs that help people with disabilities use the internet. If you use them right they can help people access your website a bit easier.</ul>
