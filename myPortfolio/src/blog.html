            <ul>Day 1 of Coding</ul>    
            I learned how to start a base code for my portfolio website. We put in a custom background and our own image for our self photo.

What really excites me is that I can make a website and code it just how I would like. It gives me control over the code and I know more about websites and code.

It tells the program what coding language you are using and should be put in at the beginning of your code.

I believe it determines how the layout of the code will be for that pacific code.

            <ul>Day 2 of COding</ul>
                I learned how to put a “link” in my website so people can click on it to go to my blogs. Also I learned that coding will get frustrating and won’t work sometimes, even if you have everything set up and it all is written good.

The workflow is pretty easy as long as you have a general idea on what you are trying to make your website look and feel like.

ARIA and screen readers are programs that help people with disabilities use the internet. If you use them right they can help people access your website a bit easier.
